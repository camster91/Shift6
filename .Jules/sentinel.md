**Vulnerability:** Hardcoded credentials and placeholders in build configurations (Android signing passwords).
**Learning:** Hardcoding even placeholders or redacted values in sensitive areas like `build.gradle` can lead to accidental exposure of credentials or brittle configurations. Using environment variables ensures better security and flexibility across different environments.
**Prevention:** Always use environment variables for any sensitive data or environment-specific identifiers. Document these requirements in a `.env.example` file.
