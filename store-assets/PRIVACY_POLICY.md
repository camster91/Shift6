# Privacy Policy for Shift6

**Last Updated: January 25, 2026**

## Introduction

Shift6 ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the Shift6 fitness application handles your information.

## Summary

**Shift6 does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.** All your workout data stays entirely on your device.

## Data Storage

### What Data is Stored

Shift6 stores the following information locally on your device:

- **Workout History**: Records of completed exercises, dates, and performance metrics
- **Progress Data**: Your advancement through the 6-week program
- **Personal Records**: Your best performances for each exercise
- **App Preferences**: Settings like theme preference, audio settings, and training schedule
- **Body Metrics** (optional): Weight and measurements if you choose to track them

### Where Data is Stored

All data is stored exclusively in your device's local storage (browser localStorage for web, device storage for mobile apps). This data:

- Never leaves your device
- Is not uploaded to any server
- Is not shared with any third parties
- Is not used for analytics or advertising

### Data Backup

You can export your data using the built-in backup feature. This creates a JSON file that you control entirely. You can also import previously exported data to restore your progress.

## Data Collection

### What We Don't Collect

Shift6 does NOT collect:

- Personal identification information
- Email addresses or contact information
- Location data
- Device identifiers
- Usage analytics
- Crash reports sent to external services
- Any data transmitted over the internet

### No Accounts Required

Shift6 does not require you to create an account. There is no registration, login, or sign-up process.

## Third-Party Services

Shift6 does not integrate with any third-party services that collect data. The app functions entirely offline.

## Children's Privacy

Shift6 does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age. The app does not require any personal information to function.

## Data Deletion

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over it:

- **Delete App Data**: Use the "Factory Reset" option in the app's menu to delete all workout data
- **Uninstall**: Removing the app will delete all associated data from your device

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Contact

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through:

## Your Rights

Since Shift6 doesn't collect any personal data, traditional data rights (access, correction, deletion, portability) are inherently satisfied - you already have complete control over all your data on your device.
